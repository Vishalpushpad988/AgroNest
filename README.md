## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

*   **Microsoft SQL Server** (Express or any other edition)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AgroNest.git
    cd AgroNest
    ```

2.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
    *   Run the SQL script provided in `/Database/database_schema.sql` to create the necessary tables and initial user data.
    *   *Note: The script includes a default user (`admin`/`admin123`) for initial login.*

3.  **Configure Connection String:**
    *   Open the `Web.config` file in the root of the project.
    *   Locate the `<connectionStrings>` section.
    *   Update the `DefaultConnection` string with your SQL Server instance details (server name, database name, and credentials).
    ```xml
    <connectionStrings>
      <add name="DefaultConnection" 
           connectionString="Data Source=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Initial Catalog=AgroNestDB;Integrated Security=False;User ID=your_sql_user;Password=your_sql_password;" 
           providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
    </connectionStrings>
    ```

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works: The Application Flow

AgroNest is designed as a **Single-Page Application (SPA)**, where the page content is dynamically updated using JavaScript and AJAX, preventing full-page reloads and providing a faster user experience.

1.  **Initial Load:** The `Main.aspx` page loads once after login. It contains the HTML structure for the sidebar, top navigation, and all content sections (Dashboard, Sales, etc.), which are initially hidden except for the dashboard.
2.  **Navigation:** When a user clicks a link in the sidebar, a JavaScript function is triggered.
3.  **Content Switching:** The script hides the current content `div` and displays the `div` corresponding to the clicked link.
4.  **Data Fetching (AJAX):** To populate the displayed section with data, JavaScript makes an **AJAX call** to a specific `[WebMethod]` in the `Main.aspx.vb` code-behind file.
5.  **Backend Processing:** The VB.NET `WebMethod` executes business logic, queries the SQL Server database, and returns the data as a JSON object.
6.  **Rendering Data:** The JavaScript success callback receives the JSON data and dynamically renders it into the HTML (e.g., populating tables, updating charts, or filling form fields).

This client-side rendering approach makes the application highly responsive and efficient.
